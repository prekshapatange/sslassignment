Whispers of the Night

In the quiet hush of eveningâ€™s sigh,
When stars begin to paint the sky,
The moonlight weaves a silver thread,
Across the world where dreams are fed.
The wind it whispers through the trees,
A gentle song, a tender breeze,
It carries tales from far and wide,
Of oceans deep and mountains high.
